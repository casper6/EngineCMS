## How to use

Using Toast is easy. First, link to toast.css in your HTML document's head:

```<link rel="stylesheet" href="toast/toast.css">```

Then, to use the grid, you'll need a wrap and a grids container.

    <div class="wrap">
      <div class="grids">
        <div class="grid-two-thirds">
    
        </div>
        <div class="grid-4">
    
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
